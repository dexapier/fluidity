REQUIREMENTS:

GTK 2.16+
PyGTK
PyYAML
parsedatetime module for Python
Tomboy, for project notes integration (Gnote not supported: http://goo.gl/SGKl)


First, make sure your have the Python module 'parsedatetime' installed.

If you're not sure, run this command:  python -c 'import parsedatetime'
If it's not installed, you'll get an error that ends with 
"ImportError: No module named parsedatetime".
If you get that error, run this as root: pip-python install parsedatetime
(or, on some Linux distros, just use 'pip' instead of 'pip-python' for the above)


Next, install Fluidity itself.  Two main options are available:
    1. Download and unpack a the source archive, 'cd' to that directory, and then 
       run as root: ./install.sh
    2. Use 'pip' -- run the following as root (note that you might need to replace
       'pip-python' with just 'pip' on some Linux distros):
           pip-python install fluidity
           gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/hicolor
    3. There is no third option.  It should be "Install the distro package.", but
       Fluidity isn't currently packaged anywhere but PyPi (yet?).

DO NOT DELETE THIS FOLDER OR ITS SUBFOLDERS!
(this message, however, can be safely deleted.)

This is where Project-related files go.  This directory path will 
probably never be configurable, barring using an XDG user directory, which 
seems unlikely.  If it really bothers you that much, run the following 
in a terminal:

echo "Projects" >> ~/.hidden

And/or you can symlink it however you want.  However, somehow, the path 
/home/your-username/Projects *must* exist, along with all the subfolders
it includes.

If that still doesn't take care of you, contact me and let me know what
the issue is.  I can be reached via Google Talk or Gmail with this ID:

(You'll have to add the @gmail.com part yourself - I kept it off due to
spam paranoia.)

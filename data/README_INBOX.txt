If having this folder is a problem for you, run the following in a shell:

echo "Inbox" >> ~/.hidden


If that still doesn't take care of you, contact me and let me know what
the issue is.  I can be reached via Google Talk or Gmail with this ID: 
jens.knutson

(You'll have to add the @gmail.com part yourself - I kept it off due to
spam paranoia on my part.)
